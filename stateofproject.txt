As of September 30th, 2015, I have determined the bean will not work as it is not a central BlueTooth LE device but a peripheral BTLE device which means it cannot communicate with other devices but must be reached from the primary device.

Might look at the RFduino as an option. not sure.

Project is currently on indefinite hold.

I am eating pizza.
