Project for a wearable, bluetooth scanning earing

This project is going to be three primary parts:
1) The Arduino-compatible code to scan for bluetooth devices and trigger patterns on an RGB LED
2) The Fritzing diagram of how to wire the Bean
3) The designs for attaching this to my ear/glasses

Instructions for setting up the LightBlue Bean

1) Don't buy LightBlue Bean unless you have Bluetooth LE 4.0 or greater
2) If you ignore step one and still have one, get a 4.0 microusb adapter. I bought the IOGEAR one
3) Download XCode tools from developer.apple
4) Download Hardware Tools from developer.apple
5) Use Bluetooth Explorer to select adapter
6) Try not to crush the bean into many small pieces
